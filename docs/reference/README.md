# Component Reference

The following `IConverter` components have been developed:

* [DynamicConverter](dynamic.md)
* [FromStringRepresentationConverter](fromStringRep.md)
* [IdentityConverter](identity.md)
* [ToNullableConverter](toNullable.md)
* [ToStringConverter](toString.md)
* [TryParseConverter](tryParse.md)


These components may or may not have been configured in the [default pipeline](pipeline.md). If another configuration is desired the `DataConverter` constructor can be called with a custom sequence of converters.
