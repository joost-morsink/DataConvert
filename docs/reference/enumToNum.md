# EnumToNumericConverter
This converter converts an enum value to its numeric counterpart. 
This conversion supports `int` and `long` for to-types and always succeeds.
No bounds checking is done for enums that have the `long` underlying type.

This converter is not configurable and has no constructor parameters.
